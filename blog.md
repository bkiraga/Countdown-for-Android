Our first step was to meet with our project supervisor. We discussed the project implementatiion, the features and the problems we might face. We also evaluated the advantages of using certain technologies over other ones (i.e. Kotlin vs Java). 
We are now creating a mock Android application. This is our first deliverable, in terms of code.

We have considered the architecture of our system and we have observed that one of the services offered by a third party are no longer available. We must now implement the gameroom on the server side.
