Our first step was to meet with our project supervisor. We discussed the project implementatiion, the features and the problems we might face. We also evaluated the advantages of using certain technologies over other ones (i.e. Kotlin vs Java). 
We are now creating a mock Android application. This is our first deliverable, in terms of code.
