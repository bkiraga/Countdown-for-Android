## Project Description

Countdown for Android is a multiplayer game designed for Android OS. It
implements similar game logic to the one presented in the TV show “Countdown”. It
has three main rounds. The rounds are Letters, Numbers and Conundrum.

1. **Letters** ​is the first round of the game. The player must select between vowels
    and consonants nine times. Every selection returns a random vowel or
    consonant, respectively. The player must find the longest possible word using
    the available letters.
2. **Numbers** ​is the second round. It consists of the user receiving a random
    number and a set of six numbers. The user must use some or all of the
    following mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and
    division, in order to obtain a number close or equal to the target number.
3. **Conundrum** ​is the third round of the game. The player is presented with a set
    of nine letters and must use them all in order to create a word present in the
    English dictionary.
The player has thirty second to complete each round. A timer function will ensure the
accuracy of the allowed time.
The score is calculated based on the length of the word produced in Letters round,
how close the player is from obtaining the target number in the Numbers round and
on whether or not the player is able to complete the Conundrum round.


The player will have the opportunity to play against other people. The player will be
able to select which round of the game they are playing or they can play all the
rounds.

## Division of Work:

The work will be divided in the following way:

1. The architecture of the App will be developed by both members of the team.
2. The game server will be developed by Gheorghe-Vasile Burac and Bartlomiej
    Kiraga in pair programming.
3. The Letters round will make use of a Trie data structure and various
    algorithms. This part will be implemented by Bartlomiej Kiraga and Gheorghe
    Burac in pair programming.
4. The Numbers round must have an algorithm that produces a solution to the
    challenge of finding a mathematical equation that results the target number.
    The equation will make use of mathematical operations such as addition,
    subtraction, multiplication and division. This deliverable will be implemented
    by both team members in pair programming.
5. Conundrum rounds will be developed by both team members in pair
    programming.
6. The User Interface will be developed by both team members. Each will be
    assigned specific screens or tasks.
7. Code reviews will be carried out by the team member who is not the author of
    the code.

## Programming language(s):

The application will be developed in the following programming languages Kotlin,
Java.

## Programming tool(s):

The following tools will be used to develop the app: Android Studio, Android KTX,
Kotlin-friendly SDK, Unity and IntelliJ. We may also use MongoDB and Nginx.


## Learning Challenges:

The learning challenges identified so far are:

1. Learning Kotlin
2. Learning Android App development
3. Learn about Java libraries associated with Android App development
4. Learn how to build a professional and accessible User Interface for an
    Android App.
5. Learn how to use the Trie data structure to solve our Letters round problem.
6. Learn how to develop an algorithm for the Numbers round.
7. Learn how to search through a zipped file.

## Hardware / software platform:

The project will be developed to run on mobile hardware such as phones and tablets.
The software platform for our project is Android OS.

## Special hardware / software requirements:

There are no special hardware or software requirements.
